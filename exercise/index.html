      <h2>Establishing Your Sleep Schedule</h2>
      <div class="step">
        <b class="whb">Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.</b> <a href="/Adjust-Your-Sleep-Schedule" title="Adjust Your Sleep Schedule">Change your sleeping habits</a> so that each day is the same -- even on weekends. The best way to do this is to figure out what time you need to be up for work or school, then calculate backwards to ensure that you'll get enough hours of sleep. This will give you your bedtime and wake-up time.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 1"><a href="#_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
        <li>For example, you may need to get up at 6:00 a.m. to be at work by 8:00 a.m. To get 7-9 hours of sleep, you'd need to set your bedtime sometime between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.</li>
        <li>If you need to get used to going to bed earlier, it's best to do so in 15-30 minute intervals. Let your body get used to the earlier bedtime before you set it another 15-30 minutes earlier.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 2"><a href="#_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

      <div class="step">
        <b class="whb">Avoid catching up on sleep over the weekend.</b> This wrecks your sleep schedule, making it harder to get the good sleep you need. Do your best to stick to the same sleep schedule during the weekend as you need during your work week. Over time, this will have you feeling well-rested.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 3"><a href="#_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
        <ul>
          <li>At first, you may want to schedule early morning activities on your weekend days so that you have an incentive to rise early. For example, make a plan with a friend or partner to go on an early morning hike.</li>
          <li>Don't plan any late-night events on Friday or Saturday while you're trying to establish your sleep schedule. After you establish your sleep schedule, you can occasionally sleep in for 1-2 hours without disturbing your sleep schedule.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 4"><a href="#_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
          </li>
          <li>It can take weeks to establish your sleep schedule, depending on your current sleep and wake cycle. Plan to adjust your bedtime by just 15-30 minutes at a time.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference" aria-label="Link to Reference 5"><a href="#_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
