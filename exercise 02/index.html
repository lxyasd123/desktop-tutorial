 <p><strong>Having trouble sleeping can leave you feeling physically and emotionally drained. Sleep is vital for living a healthy, happy life. Fortunately, good sleep may be within your reach! If you want a good night's sleep, start by getting on a sleep schedule and creating a good sleep environment for falling asleep. Next, create a routine that helps you wind down before bed. It's also important that you make lifestyle changes that help support healthy sleep and feeling refreshed in the morning.</strong></p>

  <div id="1.Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.">
     <li><p><strong>1.Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.</strong> Change your sleeping habits so that each day is the same -- even on weekends. The best way to do this is to figure out what time you need to be up for work or school, then calculate backwards to ensure that you'll get enough hours of sleep. This will give you your bedtime and wake-up time.[</p></li>
    <ul>
     <li><p><em>Some flyers prefer window seats.</em> The benefit of a window seat is that you can use the side of the plane as a cozy nook in which you can sleep. Also, the view outside the plane can provide natural beauty you can enjoy if you find your activities are becoming tedious. The major drawback to window seats is the difficulty you'll face potentially crossing over two other people when going for a walk or trying to use the bathroom.</p></li>

  <div id="2.Avoid catching up on sleep over the weekend.">
      <li><p><strong>2.Avoid catching up on sleep over the weekend.</strong>This wrecks your sleep schedule, making it harder to get the good sleep you need. Do your best to stick to the same sleep schedule during the weekend as you need during your work week. Over time, this will have you feeling well-rested.</p></li>

      <li><p><em>You might want to download some relaxing white noise tracks onto your media player to drown out other passengers or loud children.</em> Rain sounds, beach sounds, and meditative tracks with gentle music accompanying natural noises can transport you to a more tranquil place.</p></li>
      <li><P><em>Many long flight travelers recommend wearing compression socks, especially when flying economy. </em>The limited amount of space and long periods of time spent stationary can cause swelling in your feet and ankles or a dangerous condition called deep vein thrombosis. Compression socks can help prevent this.</P></li>

  <div id="3.Make sure you're getting enough hours of sleep.">
      <li><p><strong>3.Sleep hours can vary depending on your age. Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep each night, while teenagers require 8-11 hours each night. Children should get 10-13 hours of sleep each night./p></li>
    <ul>
	  <li><p><em>Raise your toes while sitting.</em> Keep your heels on the floor and slowly raise your toes as high as you can. Then lower your toes, and repeat this motion with your heels while keeping your toes on the floor. Do this 7 - 10 times with controlled, deliberate motion.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Raise and twist your legs.</em> You may have better results with this exercise if you recline your chair as much as possible first. Then, raise your legs as much as you can and rotate your toes in a clockwise motion until you complete at least 6 rotations. Then repeat the motion going counterclockwise the same number of rotations.</p></li> 
      <li><p><em>Bring your knees to your chest. </em>This engages both your abdominal muscles and your legs. Lean forward a little bit so your back is off your chair. After that, bring one knee as close to your chest as you can, using both hands to support it gently. Hold this pose for 15 to 20 seconds, then lower your leg and repeat the process with your other leg. Do this at least 3 times.</p></li>

  <div id="4.Keep naps short and to a minimum.">
      <li><p><strong>4.Keep naps short and to a minimum.</strong> Your schedule doesn't have to be set in stone, but by plotting out your plans for your flight time you can arrange activities to prevent boring gaps during your journey. You might plan on spending the first two hours of your trip getting situated and doing some light reading. At about the third hour of your flight, complimentary beverages, including alcohol, are usually offered. You may want to skip alcoholic drinks; the cabin will already be dry, alcohol can lead to dehydration, and alcohol can also hurt your quality of sleep.[6] After that you might:</p></li>
    <ul>
	  <li><p><em>Consider taking a nap or getting as much sleep as possible at around the five hour mark. </em>Natural sleep aids, like chamomile, Valerian root, and melatonin may help.[7][8][9] By planning a nap toward the middle of your long flight, you break up your activities so you hopefully won't get bored of in-seat entertainment.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Think about a walk down the aisle at the eight hour mark. </em>Even regular in-seat exercise isn't a substitute for stretching your legs. After your nap, a little past the halfway point of your flight, excuse yourself from your seat and take a stroll. This is also a good opportunity to visit the restroom and freshen up with your in-flight toiletry bag.</p></li> 
      <li><p><em>Enjoy your planned activities between hours eight and ten of your trip. </em>Settle in for a good movie, read your book, do your puzzles -- occupy yourself with all the enjoyable things you've brought along for the flight.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Try to catch a little more rest at hour ten.</em> Your quality of sleep on a long flight probably won't be as good or as long as what you're used to. If you feel sleepy, listen to your body, but following a relaxing movie, a good read, or some puzzle work, you might find yourself ready for another short nap.</p></li>
      	<li><p><em>Finish out the rest of your flight with planned activities.</em> This is also a good chance for you to do your in-flight exercises. Doing your exercises now will prepare your body for de-planing, snagging luggage, and making your way to a hot or wherever it is you're headed. You might also want to take another trip to the restroom an hour before you land so you feel refreshed when you reach your destination.</p></li>
